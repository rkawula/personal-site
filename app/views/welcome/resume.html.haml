        Created the CRUD operations for user profiles, the OmniAuth login, the calendar feature, and some theme tweaks to personalize our website. Built with Ruby on Rails.

        Learned D3 and HTML5 to implement a collapsible, directed, acylic graph visualization for JSON received through AJAX calls to an external database. I created the entire Python back-end, including a script to parse trees based off of user requests for abritrary roots in real-time. (Note that the external database has been taken down, so our AJAX calls no longer work)

        %br
        Built with Ruby on Rails, using RSpec and Cucumber for testing. I also use Chef and Vagrant for a controlled, easily set up development/testing environment. The interface and screen resizing is done through Twitter Bootstrap.

        Summer 2015 - Web portal for Gap Inc's Business Intelligence tools.
        %br
        Built with JRuby on Rails, I created the full-stack website.
        %br
        Used Bootstrap for a device agnostic interface, and created a Ruby service to read updates from a database and provide dynamic notifications through a Server Sent Event stream. On the front-end, I wrote JavaScript/jQuery script to listen and flash notifications.
        %br
        The webapp was multithreaded, with a service thread to poll the database for updates. I tested over 50% of the application with RSpec 3.3 and Cucumber. Used TDD and BDD for the last half of the application, and used Chef for dependency management for deployment.
        %br
        Also wrote basic CRUD operations in a SQL/PostgreSQL environment, created multiple tables (and join tables), and wrote hand-off documentation.

        Spring 2014 - Java birthday desktop application.
        Users were able to do CRUD operations on birthday entries, write/read from disk, and sort based on different criteria.

This included using builder patterns, meeting 100% code quality as tracked through Sonar, pair programming on user stories as tracked through an Agile Jira board, and test driven development. I also wrote unit, component, and integration tests through JUnit and Mockito.
